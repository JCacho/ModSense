# ModSense
### The Lego power strip. We built it smart, modular and connected.

## Inspiration
Have you never tried to plug your computer charger to the power strip but you didn't find any vacant space? Of course you have, because you don't have a ModSense power strip.
Do you at least know how much power you are wasting with your electronics when you are not using them? Well... we can also help you with that.

## What it does
**ModSense is a smart, modular and connected power strip**. You don't have to adjust to the product, the product adjusts to you. Add how many modules you need, to plug how many devices you want. All sockets have power measurement and can be turned on and off remotely, controlled in a web browser and by a mobile application. You can program your power strip to turn off the devices at a certain hour or under certain conditions ( e.g. the temperature in the room is above 25ÂºC, so you want to turn off the socket controlling the heater or if you shutdown your computer it can automatically turn off the peripherals). Because it is modular, each socket can have a different feature, like temperature sensing, air quality sensing, noise sensing or it can even act as a wifi repeater. All this data is sent to a server where it is accessible through a web browser and a mobile application where the communication works both ways.

## How we built it
We designed a 3D model off a power socket that can be combined into a power strip by just adding more modules.
